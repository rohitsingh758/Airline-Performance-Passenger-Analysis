# Airline-Performance-Passenger-Analysis
This Project analyzes airline passenger data containing 1,000 passenger records to uncover insights related to passenger volume, airline performance, flight punctuality, revenue trends, and travel behavior. The dashboard is designed to help airline stakeholders make data-driven decisions for improving operational efficiency and customer experience.

**Problem Statement**
Airline companies manage large volumes of operational and passenger data daily. However, without proper analysis, airlines face challenges in understanding passenger demand, route performance, delays, cancellations, and revenue efficiency.
Lack of clear insights can lead to poor scheduling decisions, increased operational costs, and reduced customer satisfaction.
This project aims to provide data-driven insights to help airlines improve operational efficiency and passenger experience.

**Project Objectives**

The objectives of this project are to analyze airline data and identify patterns across routes, time periods, delays, and passenger traffic. Using Power BI dashboards, the project aims to:

1.Identify top-performing and underperforming routes

2.Analyze flight delays and cancellation trends

3.Understand passenger traffic by airline and airport

4.Identify peak travel times to improve scheduling

5.Support airline management in operational and revenue planning

**Dataset Overview**

Number of Records: 1000

Data Cleaning: Performed using Excel and Power BI

**Columns Used**

Passenger , Age , Source Airport , Gender , Airline , Destination , travel class , Flight date , Delay Minutes , Ticket Price , Flight Status

**Tools & Technologies**

**Excel** – Data cleaning and initial exploration

**SQL** – Data transformation, aggregations, KPI calculations

**Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

1.Total Passengers: 1,000

2.Average Ticket Price: ₹7.21K

3.Average Delay Time: 48.65 minutes

4.Top Airline by Passenger Count: Vistara (~206 passengers)

5.Highest Average Ticket Price: Akasa Air (~₹7.5K)

6.Most Common Flight Status: Delayed flights

7.Dominant Travel Class: Business Class

8.Major Passenger Age Group: Elder passengers

**Key Insights**

1.Passenger traffic is evenly spread across airlines, with Vistara and Indigo leading slightly, showing a competitive market.

2.Male and female passengers are almost equally represented, with a small dominance of male travelers.

3.Indigo records the highest average delays, with Akasa Air and Vistara also experiencing notable delays.

4.Flight delays remain high throughout the year and peak during the mid-year months.

5.Delayed flights form a significant portion of total flights, indicating operational inefficiencies.

6.Akasa Air charges the highest average ticket prices, while Air India remains the most affordable.

7.Business class generates higher revenue despite having fewer passengers.

8.Business class is slightly more preferred than economy, indicating a high-value customer base.

9.Elder passengers make up the largest share of travelers, followed by adult passengers.

10.Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai routes carry the highest passenger traffic and act as major travel hubs.

**Recommendations**

1.**Reduce Flight Delays**

Focus on airlines with higher average delays (Indigo, Akasa Air) by improving scheduling, ground handling, and turnaround time.

2.**Optimize Peak-Delay Months**

Increase buffer time and operational staffing during months with high delay trends to improve on-time performance.

3.**Leverage Business Class Demand**

Introduce premium services, loyalty benefits, and flexible pricing to further monetize business class travelers.

4.**Target Elder Passengers**

Design senior-friendly services such as priority boarding, medical assistance, and discounted fares for elder travelers.

5.**Route-Based Capacity Planning**

Increase flight frequency and aircraft capacity on high-traffic routes like Delhi–Bangalore and Mumbai–Delhi.

6.**Competitive Pricing Strategy**

Airlines with lower ticket prices can bundle services to increase value, while premium airlines can justify higher pricing through improved punctuality.
